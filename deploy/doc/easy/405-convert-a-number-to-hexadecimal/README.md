# [Convert a Number to Hexadecimal][title]

## Description

Given a 32-bit integer `num`, return _a string representing its hexadecimal
representation_. For negative integers, [two's
complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.

All the letters in the answer string should be lowercase characters, and there
should not be any leading zeros in the answer except for the zero itself.

**Note:  **You are not allowed to use any built-in library method to directly
