# [Harshad Number][title]

## Description

An integer divisible by the **sum** of its digits is said to be a **Harshad**
number. You are given an integer `x`. Return _the sum of the digits_ of __`x`
__ if __`x` __ is a **Harshad** number, otherwise, return __`-1` _._



**Example 1:**

Input: x = 18

Output: 9

Explanation:

The sum of digits of `x` is `9`. `18` is divisible by `9`. So `18` is a
Harshad number and the answer is `9`.

**Example 2:**

Input: x = 23

Output: -1

Explanation:

The sum of digits of `x` is `5`. `23` is not divisible by `5`. So `23` is not
a Harshad number and the answer is `-1`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= x <= 100`


**Tags:** Math

**Difficulty:** Easy
