# [Number of Common Factors][title]

## Description

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return _the number of**common**
factors of _`a` _and_`b`.

An integer `x` is a **common factor** of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a`
and `b`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: a = 12, b = 6    Output: 4    Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: a = 25, b = 30    Output: 2    Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a, b <= 1000`


**Tags:** Math, Enumeration, Number Theory

**Difficulty:** Easy
