# [Longest Uncommon Subsequence I][title]

## Description

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the length of the**longest uncommon
subsequence** between _`a` _and_ `b`. _If no such uncommon subsequence exists,
return_ `-1` _._

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a
**subsequence of exactly one of them**.



**Example 1:**
            Input: a = "aba", b = "cdc"    Output: 3    Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".    Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: a = "aaa", b = "bbb"    Output: 3    Explanation:  The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".    

**Example 3:**
            Input: a = "aaa", b = "aaa"    Output: -1    Explanation:  Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be -1.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
  * `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.


**Tags:** String

**Difficulty:** Easy
