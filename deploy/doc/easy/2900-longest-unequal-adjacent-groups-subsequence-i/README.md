# [Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I][title]

## Description

You are given a string array `words` and a **binary** array `groups` both of
length `n`.

A subsequence of `words` is **alternating** if for any two _consecutive_
strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements at the _same_ indices in
`groups` are **different** (that is, there _cannot_ be consecutive 0 or 1).

Your task is to select the **longest alternating** subsequence from `words`.

Return _the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return**any**
of them._

**Note:** The elements in `words` are distinct.



**Example 1:**

Input: words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]

Output: ["e","b"]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is `["e","b"]` because
`groups[0] != groups[2]`. Another subsequence that can be selected is
`["a","b"]` because `groups[1] != groups[2]`. It can be demonstrated that the
length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is
`2`.

**Example 2:**

Input: words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,0,1,1]

Output: ["a","b","c"]

Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is `["a","b","c"]` because
`groups[0] != groups[1]` and `groups[1] != groups[2]`. Another subsequence
that can be selected is `["a","b","d"]` because `groups[0] != groups[1]` and
`groups[1] != groups[3]`. It can be shown that the length of the longest
subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is `3`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == words.length == groups.length <= 100`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
  * `groups[i]` is either `0` or `1.`
  * `words` consists of **distinct** strings.
  * `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
