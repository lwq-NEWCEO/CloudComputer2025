# [Remove Zeros in Decimal Representation][title]

## Description

You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

Return the integer obtained by removing all zeros from the decimal
representation of `n`.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 1020030

Output: 123

Explanation:

After removing all zeros from 1** _0_** 2** _00_** 3** _0_** , we get 123.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 1

Output: 1

Explanation:

1 has no zero in its decimal representation. Therefore, the answer is 1.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1015`


**Tags:** Math, Simulation

**Difficulty:** Easy
