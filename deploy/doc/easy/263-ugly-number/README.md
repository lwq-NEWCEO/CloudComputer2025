## Description

An **ugly number** is a _positive_ integer which does not have a prime factor
other than 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _is an**ugly number**_.



**Example 1:**
            Input: n = 6    Output: true    Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3    

**Example 2:**
            Input: n = 1    Output: true    Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.    

**Example 3:**
            Input: n = 14    Output: false    Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.    



**Constraints:**

  * `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`


**Tags:** Math

**Difficulty:** Easy
