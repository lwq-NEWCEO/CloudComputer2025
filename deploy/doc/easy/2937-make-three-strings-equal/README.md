# [Make Three Strings Equal][title]

## Description

You are given three strings: `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. In one operation you can
choose one of these strings and delete its **rightmost** character. Note that
you **cannot** completely empty a string.

Return the _minimum number of operations_ required to make the strings equal
_._ If it is impossible to make them equal, return `-1`.



**Example 1:**

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"

Output: 2

**Explanation:  **Deleting the rightmost character from both `s1` and `s2`
will result in three equal strings.

**Example 2:**

Input: s1 = "dac", s2 = "bac", s3 = "cac"

Output: -1

Explanation: Since the first letters of `s1` and `s2` differ, they cannot
be made equal.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100`
  * `s1`, `s2` and `s3` consist only of lowercase English letters.


**Tags:** String

**Difficulty:** Easy
