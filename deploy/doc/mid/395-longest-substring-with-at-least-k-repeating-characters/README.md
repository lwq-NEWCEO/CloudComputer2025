# [Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters][title]

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest
substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring
is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

if no such substring exists, return 0.



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3    Output: 3    Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2    Output: 5    Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
  * `1 <= k <= 105`


**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Divide and Conquer, Sliding Window

**Difficulty:** Medium
