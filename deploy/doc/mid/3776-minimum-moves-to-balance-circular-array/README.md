# [Minimum Moves to Balance Circular Array][title]

## Description

You are given a **circular** array `balance` of length `n`, where `balance[i]`
is the net balance of person `i`.

In one move, a person can transfer **exactly** 1 unit of balance to either
their left or right neighbor.

Return the **minimum** number of moves required so that every person has a
**non-negative** balance. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Note** : You are guaranteed that **at most** 1 index has a **negative**
balance initially.



**Example 1:**

Input: balance = [5,1,-4]

Output: 4

Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

  * Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [5, 0, -3]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [4, 0, -2]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [3, 0, -1]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [2, 0, 0]`

Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 4.

**Example 2:**

Input: balance = [1,2,-5,2]

Output: 6

Explanation:

One optimal sequence of moves is:

  * Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 1, -4, 2]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -3, 2]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 3` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -2, 1]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 3` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [1, 0, -1, 0]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 0` to `i = 1`, resulting in `balance = [0, 1, -1, 0]`
  * Move 1 unit from `i = 1` to `i = 2`, resulting in `balance = [0, 0, 0, 0]`

Thus, the minimum number of moves required is 6.​​​

**Example 3:**

Input: balance = [-3,2]

Output: -1

Explanation:

**​​​​​​​** It is impossible to make all balances non-negative for `balance =
[-3, 2]`, so the answer is -1.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == balance.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= balance[i] <= 109`
  * There is at most one negative value in `balance` initially.
