# [Minimum Time to Complete All Deliveries][title]

## Description

You are given two integer arrays of size 2: `d = [d1, d2]` and `r = [r1, r2]`.

Two delivery drones are tasked with completing a specific number of
deliveries. Drone `i` must complete `di` deliveries.

Each delivery takes **exactly** one hour and **only one** drone can make a
delivery at any given hour.

Additionally, both drones require recharging at specific intervals during
which they cannot make deliveries. Drone `i` must recharge every `ri` hours
(i.e. at hours that are multiples of `ri`).

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total time (in hours) required to
complete all deliveries.



**Example 1:**

Input: d = [3,1], r = [2,3]

Output: 5

Explanation:

  * The first drone delivers at hours 1, 3, 5 (recharges at hours 2, 4).
  * The second drone delivers at hour 2 (recharges at hour 3).

**Example 2:**

Input: d = [1,3], r = [2,2]

Output: 7

Explanation:

  * The first drone delivers at hour 3 (recharges at hours 2, 4, 6).
  * The second drone delivers at hours 1, 5, 7 (recharges at hours 2, 4, 6).

**Example 3:**

Input: d = [2,1], r = [3,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

  * The first drone delivers at hours 1, 2 (recharges at hour 3).
  * The second drone delivers at hour 3.



**Constraints:**

  * `d = [d1, d2]`
  * `1 <= di <= 109`
  * `r = [r1, r2]`
  * `2 <= ri <= 3 * 104`
