# [Maximum Product of First and Last Elements of a Subsequence][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `m`.

Return the **maximum** product of the first and last elements of any
**subsequence** of `nums` of size `m`.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [-1,-9,2,3,-2,-3,1], m = 1

Output: 81

Explanation:

The subsequence `[-9]` has the largest product of the first and last elements:
`-9 * -9 = 81`. Therefore, the answer is 81.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,3,-5,5,6,-4], m = 3

Output: 20

Explanation:

The subsequence `[-5, 6, -4]` has the largest product of the first and last
elements.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [2,-1,2,-6,5,2,-5,7], m = 2

Output: 35

Explanation:

The subsequence `[5, 7]` has the largest product of the first and last
elements.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`
  * `1 <= m <= nums.length`


**Tags:** Array, Two Pointers

**Difficulty:** Medium
