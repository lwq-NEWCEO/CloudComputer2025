# [Count Caesar Cipher Pairs][title]

## Description

You are given an array `words` of `n` strings. Each string has length `m` and
contains only lowercase English letters.

Two strings `s` and `t` are **similar** if we can apply the following
operation any number of times (possibly zero times) so that `s` and `t` become
**equal**.

  * Choose either `s` or `t`.
  * Replace **every** letter in the chosen string with the next letter in the alphabet cyclically. The next letter after `'z'` is `'a'`.

Count the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

  * `i < j`
  * `words[i]` and `words[j]` are **similar**.

Return an integer denoting the number of such pairs.



**Example 1:**

Input: words = ["fusion","layout"]

Output: 1

Explanation:

`words[0] = "fusion"` and `words[1] = "layout"` are similar because we can
apply the operation to `"fusion"` 6 times. The string `"fusion"` changes as
follows.

  * `"fusion"`
  * `"gvtjpo"`
  * `"hwukqp"`
  * `"ixvlrq"`
  * `"jywmsr"`
  * `"kzxnts"`
  * `"layout"`

**Example 2:**

Input: words = ["ab","aa","za","aa"]

Output: 2

Explanation:

`words[0] = "ab"` and `words[2] = "za"` are similar. `words[1] = "aa"` and
`words[3] = "aa"` are similar.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == words.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= m == words[i].length <= 105`
  * `1 <= n * m <= 105`
  * `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
