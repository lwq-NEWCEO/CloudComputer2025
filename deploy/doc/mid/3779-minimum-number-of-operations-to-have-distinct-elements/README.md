# [Minimum Number of Operations to Have Distinct Elements][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

In one operation, you remove the **first three elements** of the current
array. If there are fewer than three elements remaining, **all** remaining
elements are removed.

Repeat this operation until the array is empty or contains no duplicate
values.

Return an integer denoting the number of operations required.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [3,8,3,6,5,8]

Output: 1

Explanation:

In the first operation, we remove the first three elements. The remaining
elements `[6, 5, 8]` are all distinct, so we stop. Only one operation is
needed.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [2,2]

Output: 1

Explanation:

After one operation, the array becomes empty, which meets the stopping
condition.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [4,3,5,1,2]

Output: 0

Explanation:

All elements in the array are distinct, therefore no operations are needed.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`


**Tags:** Array, Hash Table

**Difficulty:** Medium
