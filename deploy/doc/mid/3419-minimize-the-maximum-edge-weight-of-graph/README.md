# [Minimize the Maximum Edge Weight of Graph][title]

## Description

You are given two integers, `n` and `threshold`, as well as a **directed**
weighted graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. The graph is
represented by a **2D** integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [Ai, Bi, Wi]`
indicates that there is an edge going from node `Ai` to node `Bi` with weight
`Wi`.

You have to remove some edges from this graph (possibly **none**), so that it
satisfies the following conditions:

  * Node 0 must be reachable from all other nodes.
  * The **maximum** edge weight in the resulting graph is **minimized**.
  * Each node has **at most** `threshold` outgoing edges.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** edge weight after
removing the necessary edges. If it is impossible for all conditions to be
satisfied, return -1.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,0,1],[2,0,2],[3,0,1],[4,3,1],[2,1,1]], threshold
= 2

Output: 1

Remove the edge `2 -> 0`. The maximum weight among the remaining edges is 1.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[0,2,2],[0,3,1],[0,4,1],[1,2,1],[1,4,1]],
threshold = 1

Output: -1

Explanation:  

It is impossible to reach node 0 from node 2.

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[3,4,2],[4,0,1]],
threshold = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:  

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/12/09/s2-1.png)

Remove the edges `1 -> 3` and `1 -> 4`. The maximum weight among the remaining
edges is 2.

**Example 4:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,1],[1,3,3],[1,4,5],[2,3,2],[4,0,1]], threshold
= 1

Output: -1



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= threshold <= n - 1`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= min(105, n * (n - 1) / 2).`
  * `edges[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= Ai, Bi < n`
  * `Ai != Bi`
  * `1 <= Wi <= 106`
  * There **may be** multiple edges between a pair of nodes, but they must have unique weights.
