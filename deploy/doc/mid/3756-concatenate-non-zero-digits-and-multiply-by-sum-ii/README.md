# [Concatenate Non-Zero Digits and Multiply by Sum II][title]

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `m` consisting of digits. You are also
given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`.

For each `queries[i]`, extract the **substring** `s[li..ri]`. Then, perform
the following:

  * Form a new integer `x` by concatenating all the **non-zero digits** from the substring in their original order. If there are no non-zero digits, `x = 0`.
  * Let `sum` be the **sum of digits** in `x`. The answer is `x * sum`.

Return an array of integers `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the
`ith` query.

Since the answers may be very large, return them **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "10203004", queries = [[0,7],[1,3],[4,6]]

Output: [12340, 4, 9]

Explanation:

  * `s[0..7] = "10203004"`    * `x = 1234`    * `sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`    * Therefore, answer is `1234 * 10 = 12340`.
  * `s[1..3] = "020"`    * `x = 2`    * `sum = 2`    * Therefore, the answer is `2 * 2 = 4`.
  * `s[4..6] = "300"`    * `x = 3`    * `sum = 3`    * Therefore, the answer is `3 * 3 = 9`.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "1000", queries = [[0,3],[1,1]]

Output: [1, 0]

Explanation:

  * `s[0..3] = "1000"`    * `x = 1`    * `sum = 1`    * Therefore, the answer is `1 * 1 = 1`.
  * `s[1..1] = "0"`    * `x = 0`    * `sum = 0`    * Therefore, the answer is `0 * 0 = 0`.

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "9876543210", queries = [[0,9]]

Output: [444444137]

Explanation:

  * `s[0..9] = "9876543210"`    * `x = 987654321`    * `sum = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45`    * Therefore, the answer is `987654321 * 45 = 44444444445`.    * We return `44444444445 modulo (109 + 7) = 444444137`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= m == s.length <= 105`
  * `s` consists of digits only.
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[i] = [li, ri]`
  * `0 <= li <= ri < m`
