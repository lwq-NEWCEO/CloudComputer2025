# [Maximize Points After Choosing K Tasks][title]

## Description

You are given two integer arrays, `technique1` and `technique2`, each of
length `n`, where `n` represents the number of tasks to complete.

  * If the `ith` task is completed using technique 1, you earn `technique1[i]` points.
  * If it is completed using technique 2, you earn `technique2[i]` points.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of
tasks that **must** be completed using technique 1.

You **must** complete **at least** `k` tasks using technique 1 (they do not
need to be the first `k` tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using **either** technique.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum total points** you can earn.



**Example 1:**

Input: technique1 = [5,2,10], technique2 = [10,3,8], k = 2

Output: 22

Explanation:

We must complete at least `k = 2` tasks using `technique1`.

Choosing `technique1[1]` and `technique1[2]` (completed using technique 1),
and `technique2[0]` (completed using technique 2), yields the maximum points:
`2 + 10 + 10 = 22`.

**Example 2:**

Input: technique1 = [10,20,30], technique2 = [5,15,25], k = 2

Output: 60

Explanation:

We must complete at least `k = 2` tasks using `technique1`.

Choosing all tasks using technique 1 yields the maximum points: `10 + 20 + 30
= 60`.

**Example 3:**

Input: technique1 = [1,2,3], technique2 = [4,5,6], k = 0

Output: 15

Explanation:

Since `k = 0`, we are not required to choose any task using `technique1`.

Choosing all tasks using technique 2 yields the maximum points: `4 + 5 + 6 =
15`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == technique1.length == technique2.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= technique1[i], technique2​​​​​​​[i] <= 10​​​​​​​5`
  * `0 <= k <= n`


**Tags:** Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue)

**Difficulty:** Medium
