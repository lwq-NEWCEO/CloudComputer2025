# [Minimum Operations to Make Binary Palindrome][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

For each element `nums[i]`, you may perform the following operations **any**
number of times (including zero):

  * Increase `nums[i]` by 1, or
  * Decrease `nums[i]` by 1.

A number is called a **binary palindrome** if its binary representation
without leading zeros reads the same forward and backward.

Your task is to return an integer array `ans`, where `ans[i]` represents the
**minimum** number of operations required to convert `nums[i]` into a **binary
palindrome**.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,4]

Output: [0,1,1]

Explanation:

One optimal set of operations:

`nums[i]` | Binary(`nums[i]`) | Nearest  
Palindrome | Binary  
(Palindrome) | Operations Required | `ans[i]`  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Already palindrome | 0  
2 | 10 | 3 | 11 | Increase by 1 | 1  
4 | 100 | 3 | 11 | Decrease by 1 | 1  
  
Thus, `ans = [0, 1, 1]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [6,7,12]

Output: [1,0,3]

Explanation:

One optimal set of operations:

`nums[i]` | Binary(`nums[i]`) | Nearest  
Palindrome | Binary  
(Palindrome) | Operations Required | `ans[i]`  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
6 | 110 | 5 | 101 | Decrease by 1 | 1  
7 | 111 | 7 | 111 | Already palindrome | 0  
12 | 1100 | 15 | 1111 | Increase by 3 | 3  
  
Thus, `ans = [1, 0, 3]`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `​​​​​​​1 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
