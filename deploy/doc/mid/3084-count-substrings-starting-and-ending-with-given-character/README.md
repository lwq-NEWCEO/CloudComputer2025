# [Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character][title]

## Description

You are given a string `s` and a character `c`. Return _the total number of
substrings of _`s` _that start and end with_`c` _._



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "abada", c = "a"

Output: 6

Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with `"a"` are: `"**_a_**
bada"`, `"_**aba**_ da"`, `"_**abada**_ "`, `"ab _**a**_ da"`, `"ab _**ada**_
"`, `"abad _**a**_ "`.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"

Output: 6

Explanation: There are a total of `6` substrings in `s` and all start and
end with `"z"`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` and `c` consist only of lowercase English letters.
