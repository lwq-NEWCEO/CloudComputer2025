# [Maximum and Minimum Sums of at Most Size K Subsequences][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`. Return the
sum of the **maximum** and **minimum** elements of all **subsequences** of
`nums` with **at most** `k` elements.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2

Output: 24

Explanation:

The subsequences of `nums` with at most 2 elements are:

**Subsequence** | Minimum | Maximum | Sum  
---|---|---|---  
`[1]` | 1 | 1 | 2  
`[2]` | 2 | 2 | 4  
`[3]` | 3 | 3 | 6  
`[1, 2]` | 1 | 2 | 3  
`[1, 3]` | 1 | 3 | 4  
`[2, 3]` | 2 | 3 | 5  
**Final Total** |   |   | 24  
  
The output would be 24.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [5,0,6], k = 1

Output: 22

Explanation:

For subsequences with exactly 1 element, the minimum and maximum values are
the element itself. Therefore, the total is `5 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 22`.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2

Output: 12

Explanation:

The subsequences `[1, 1]` and `[1]` each appear 3 times. For all of them, the
minimum and maximum are both 1. Thus, the total is 12.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= min(70, nums.length)`
