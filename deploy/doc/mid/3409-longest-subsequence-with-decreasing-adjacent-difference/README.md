# [Longest Subsequence With Decreasing Adjacent Difference][title]

## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`.

Your task is to find the length of the **longest** subsequence `seq` of
`nums`, such that the **absolute differences** between _consecutive_ elements
form a **non-increasing sequence** of integers. In other words, for a
subsequence `seq0`, `seq1`, `seq2`, ..., `seqm` of `nums`, `|seq1 - seq0| >=
|seq2 - seq1| >= ... >= |seqm - seqm - 1|`.

Return the length of such a subsequence.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [16,6,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:  

The longest subsequence is `[16, 6, 3]` with the absolute adjacent differences
`[10, 3]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [6,5,3,4,2,1]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest subsequence is `[6, 4, 2, 1]` with the absolute adjacent
differences `[2, 2, 1]`.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [10,20,10,19,10,20]

Output: 5

Explanation:  

The longest subsequence is `[10, 20, 10, 19, 10]` with the absolute adjacent
differences `[10, 10, 9, 9]`.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 300`


**Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming
