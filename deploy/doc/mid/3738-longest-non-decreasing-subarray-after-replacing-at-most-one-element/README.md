# [Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray After Replacing at Most One Element][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You are allowed to replace **at most** one element in the array with any other
integer value of your choice.

Return the length of the **longest non-decreasing subarray** that can be
obtained after performing at most one replacement.

An array is said to be **non-decreasing** if each element is greater than or
equal to its previous one (if it exists).



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

Replacing `nums[3] = 1` with 3 gives the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 2].

The longest non-decreasing subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3], which has a length of 4.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 5

Explanation:

All elements in `nums` are equal, so it is already non-decreasing and the
entire `nums` forms a subarray of length 5.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`​​​​​​​


**Tags:** Array, Dynamic Programming

**Difficulty:** Medium
