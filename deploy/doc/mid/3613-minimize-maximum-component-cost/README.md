# [Minimize Maximum Component Cost][title]

## Description

You are given an undirected connected graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to
`n - 1` and a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` denotes
an undirected edge between node `ui` and node `vi` with weight `wi`, and an
integer `k`.

You are allowed to remove any number of edges from the graph such that the
resulting graph has **at most** `k` connected components.

The **cost** of a component is defined as the **maximum** edge weight in that
component. If a component has no edges, its cost is 0.

Return the **minimum** possible value of the **maximum** cost among all
components **after such removals**.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[3,4,6]], k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:

  * Remove the edge between nodes 3 and 4 (weight 6).
  * The resulting components have costs of 0 and 4, so the overall maximum cost is 4.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5]], k = 1

Output: 5

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/19/minmax2.jpg)

  * No edge can be removed, since allowing only one component (`k = 1`) requires the graph to stay fully connected.
  * That single component's cost equals its largest edge weight, which is 5.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
  * `0 <= edges.length <= 105`
  * `edges[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `1 <= wi <= 106`
  * `1 <= k <= n`
  * The input graph is connected.
