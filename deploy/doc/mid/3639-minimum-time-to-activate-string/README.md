# [Minimum Time to Activate String][title]

## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer array `order`, where
`order` is a **permutation** of the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

Starting from time `t = 0`, replace the character at index `order[t]` in `s`
with `'*'` at each time step.

A **substring** is **valid** if it contains **at least** one `'*'`.

A string is **active** if the total number of **valid** substrings is greater
than or equal to `k`.

Return the **minimum** time `t` at which the string `s` becomes **active**. If
it is impossible, return -1.



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "abc", order = [1,0,2], k = 2

Output: 0

Explanation:

`t` | `order[t]` | Modified `s` | Valid Substrings | Count | Active  
(Count >= k)  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
0 | 1 | `"a*c"` | `"*"`, `"a*"`, `"*c"`, `"a*c"` | 4 | Yes  
  
The string `s` becomes active at `t = 0`. Thus, the answer is 0.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "cat", order = [0,2,1], k = 6

Output: 2

Explanation:

`t` | `order[t]` | Modified `s` | Valid Substrings | Count | Active  
(Count >= k)  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
0 | 0 | `"*at"` | `"*"`, `"*a"`, `"*at"` | 3 | No  
1 | 2 | `"*a*"` | `"*"`, `"*a"`, `"`*a*"``, `"`a*"``, `"*"` | 5 | No  
2 | 1 | `"***"` | All substrings (contain `'*'`) | 6 | Yes  
  
The string `s` becomes active at `t = 2`. Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "xy", order = [0,1], k = 4

Output: -1

Explanation:

Even after all replacements, it is impossible to obtain `k = 4` valid
substrings. Thus, the answer is -1.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == s.length <= 105`
  * `order.length == n`
  * `0 <= order[i] <= n - 1`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `order` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n - 1`.
  * `1 <= k <= 109`
