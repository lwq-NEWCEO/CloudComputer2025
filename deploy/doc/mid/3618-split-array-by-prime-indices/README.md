# [Split Array by Prime Indices][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Split `nums` into two arrays `A` and `B` using the following rule:

  * Elements at **prime** indices in `nums` must go into array `A`.
  * All other elements must go into array `B`.

Return the **absolute** difference between the sums of the two arrays:
`|sum(A) - sum(B)|`.

**Note:** An empty array has a sum of 0.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [2,3,4]

Output: 1

Explanation:

  * The only prime index in the array is 2, so `nums[2] = 4` is placed in array `A`.
  * The remaining elements, `nums[0] = 2` and `nums[1] = 3` are placed in array `B`.
  * `sum(A) = 4`, `sum(B) = 2 + 3 = 5`.
  * The absolute difference is `|4 - 5| = 1`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [-1,5,7,0]

Output: 3

Explanation:

  * The prime indices in the array are 2 and 3, so `nums[2] = 7` and `nums[3] = 0` are placed in array `A`.
  * The remaining elements, `nums[0] = -1` and `nums[1] = 5` are placed in array `B`.
  * `sum(A) = 7 + 0 = 7`, `sum(B) = -1 + 5 = 4`.
  * The absolute difference is `|7 - 4| = 3`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
