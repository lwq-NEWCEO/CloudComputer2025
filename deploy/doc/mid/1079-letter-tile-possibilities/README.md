# [Letter Tile Possibilities][title]

## Description

You have `n`  `tiles`, where each tile has one letter `tiles[i]` printed on
it.

Return _the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters_ you can make
using the letters printed on those `tiles`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: tiles = "AAB"    Output: 8    Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".    

**Example 2:**
            Input: tiles = "AAABBC"    Output: 188    

**Example 3:**
            Input: tiles = "V"    Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= tiles.length <= 7`
  * `tiles` consists of uppercase English letters.


**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Backtracking, Counting

**Difficulty:** Medium
