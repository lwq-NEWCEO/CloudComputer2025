# [Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree][title]

## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in
**ascending order** , convert _it to a_** _height-balanced_** _binary search
tree_.



**Example 1:**

            Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]    Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]    Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: head = []    Output: []    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
  * `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
