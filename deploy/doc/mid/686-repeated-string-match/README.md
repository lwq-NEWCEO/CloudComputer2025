# [Repeated String Match][title]

## Description

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the minimum number of times you should
repeat string_`a` _so that string_ `b` _is a substring of it_. If it is
impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return
`-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is
`"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"    Output: 3    Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "ab**cdabcdab** cd", b is a substring of it.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: a = "a", b = "aa"    Output: 2    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
  * `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.
