# [Find Maximum Number of Non Intersecting Substrings][title]

## Description

You are given a string `word`.

Return the **maximum** number of non-intersecting **substrings** of word that
are at **least** four characters long and start and end with the same letter.



**Example 1:**

Input: word = "abcdeafdef"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The two substrings are `"abcdea"` and `"fdef"`.

**Example 2:**

Input: word = "bcdaaaab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only substring is `"aaaa"`. Note that we cannot **also** choose
`"bcdaaaab"` since it intersects with the other substring.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= word.length <= 2 * 105`
  * `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.


**Tags:** Hash Table, String, Dynamic Programming, Greedy

**Difficulty:** Medium
