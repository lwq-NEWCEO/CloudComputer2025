# [Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number][title]

## Description

Given an integer `num`, return _three consecutive integers (as a sorted
array)__that**sum** to _`num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of
three consecutive integers, return _an**empty** array._



**Example 1:**
            Input: num = 33    Output: [10,11,12]    Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.    10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].    

**Example 2:**
            Input: num = 4    Output: []    Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= num <= 1015`


**Tags:** Math, Simulation

**Difficulty:** Medium
