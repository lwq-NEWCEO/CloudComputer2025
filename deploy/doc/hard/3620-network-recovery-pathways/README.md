# [Network Recovery Pathways][title]

## Description

You are given a directed acyclic graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n −
1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `m`, where `edges[i] =
[ui, vi, costi]` indicates a one‑way communication from node `ui` to node `vi`
with a recovery cost of `costi`.

Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array `online` where
`online[i] = true` means node `i` is online. Nodes 0 and `n − 1` are always
online.

A path from 0 to `n − 1` is **valid** if:

  * All intermediate nodes on the path are online.
  * The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed `k`.

For each valid path, define its **score** as the minimum edge‑cost along that
path.

Return the **maximum** path score (i.e., the largest **minimum** -edge cost)
among all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1.



**Example 1:**

Input: edges = [[0,1,5],[1,3,10],[0,2,3],[2,3,4]], online =
[true,true,true,true], k = 10

Output: 3

Explanation:

  * The graph has two possible routes from node 0 to node 3:
    1. Path `0 -> 1 -> 3`
       * Total cost = `5 + 10 = 15`, which exceeds k (`15 > 10`), so this path is invalid.
    2. Path `0 -> 2 -> 3`
       * Total cost = `3 + 4 = 7 <= k`, so this path is valid.
       * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(3, 4) = 3`.

  * There are no other valid paths. Hence, the maximum among all valid path‐scores is 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: edges = [[0,1,7],[1,4,5],[0,2,6],[2,3,6],[3,4,2],[2,4,6]], online =
[true,true,true,false,true], k = 12

Output: 6

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/06/06/graph-11.png)

  * Node 3 is offline, so any path passing through 3 is invalid.

  * Consider the remaining routes from 0 to 4:
    1. Path `0 -> 1 -> 4`
       * Total cost = `7 + 5 = 12 <= k`, so this path is valid.
       * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(7, 5) = 5`.
    2. Path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`
       * Node 3 is offline, so this path is invalid regardless of cost.
    3. Path `0 -> 2 -> 4`
       * Total cost = `6 + 6 = 12 <= k`, so this path is valid.
       * The minimum edge‐cost along this path is `min(6, 6) = 6`.

  * Among the two valid paths, their scores are 5 and 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.



**Constraints:**

  * `n == online.length`
  * `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
  * `0 <= m == edges.length <= ``min(105, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
  * `edges[i] = [ui, vi, costi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `0 <= costi <= 109`
  * `0 <= k <= 5 * 1013`
  * `online[i]` is either `true` or `false`, and both `online[0]` and `online[n − 1]` are `true`.
  * The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
