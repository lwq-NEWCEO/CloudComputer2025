# [Path Existence Queries in a Graph II][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph,
labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer
`maxDiff`.

An **undirected** edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the **absolute**
difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is **at most** `maxDiff` (i.e.,
`|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui,
vi]`, find the **minimum** distance between nodes `ui` and `vi`. If no path
exists between the two nodes, return -1 for that query.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `ith` query.

**Note:** The edges between the nodes are unweighted.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 5, nums = [1,8,3,4,2], maxDiff = 3, queries = [[0,3],[2,4]]

Output: [1,1]

Explanation:

The resulting graph is:

Query | Shortest Path | Minimum Distance  
---|---|---  
[0, 3] | 0 -> 3 | 1  
[2, 4] | 2 -> 4 | 1  
  
Thus, the output is `[1, 1]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 5, nums = [5,3,1,9,10], maxDiff = 2, queries =
[[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[4,3]]

Output: [1,2,-1,1]

Explanation:

The resulting graph is:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/25/4149example2drawio.png)

Query | Shortest Path | Minimum Distance  
---|---|---  
[0, 1] | 0 -> 1 | 1  
[0, 2] | 0 -> 1 -> 2 | 2  
[2, 3] | None | -1  
[4, 3] | 3 -> 4 | 1  
  
Thus, the output is `[1, 2, -1, 1]`.

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 3, nums = [3,6,1], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2]]

Output: [0,-1,-1]

Explanation:

There are no edges between any two nodes because:

  * Nodes 0 and 1: `|nums[0] - nums[1]| = |3 - 6| = 3 > 1`
  * Nodes 0 and 2: `|nums[0] - nums[2]| = |3 - 1| = 2 > 1`
  * Nodes 1 and 2: `|nums[1] - nums[2]| = |6 - 1| = 5 > 1`

Thus, no node can reach any other node, and the output is `[0, -1, -1]`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
  * `0 <= maxDiff <= 105`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[i] == [ui, vi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
