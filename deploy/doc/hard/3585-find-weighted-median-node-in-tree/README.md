# [Find Weighted Median Node in Tree][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an **undirected, weighted** tree rooted at
node 0 with `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D
array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates an
edge from node `ui` to `vi` with weight `wi`.

The **weighted median node** is defined as the **first** node `x` on the path
from `ui` to `vi` such that the sum of edge weights from `ui` to `x` is
**greater than or equal to half** of the total path weight.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[j] = [uj, vj]`,
determine the weighted median node along the path from `uj` to `vj`.

Return an array `ans`, where `ans[j]` is the node index of the weighted median
for `queries[j]`.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1,7]], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]

Output: [0,1]

Query | Path | Edge  
Weights | Total  
Path  
Weight | Half | Explanation | Answer  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
`[1, 0]` | `1 -> 0` | `[7]` | 7 | 3.5 | Sum from `1 -> 0 = 7 >= 3.5`, median is node 0. | 0  
`[0, 1]` | `0 -> 1` | `[7]` | 7 | 3.5 | Sum from `0 -> 1 = 7 >= 3.5`, median is node 1. | 1  
  
**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[2,0,4]], queries = [[0,1],[2,0],[1,2]]

Output: [1,0,2]

Query | Path | Edge  
Weights | Total  
Path  
Weight | Half | Explanation | Answer  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
`[0, 1]` | `0 -> 1` | `[2]` | 2 | 1 | Sum from `0 -> 1 = 2 >= 1`, median is node 1. | 1  
`[2, 0]` | `2 -> 0` | `[4]` | 4 | 2 | Sum from `2 -> 0 = 4 >= 2`, median is node 0. | 0  
`[1, 2]` | `1 -> 0 -> 2` | `[2, 4]` | 6 | 3 | Sum from `1 -> 0 = 2 < 3`.  
Sum from `1 -> 2 = 2 + 4 = 6 >= 3`, median is node 2. | 2  
  
**Example 3:**

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5],[1,3,1],[2,4,3]], queries =
[[3,4],[1,2]]

Output: [2,2]

Query | Path | Edge  
Weights | Total  
Path  
Weight | Half | Explanation | Answer  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
`[3, 4]` | `3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4` | `[1, 2, 5, 3]` | 11 | 5.5 | Sum from `3 -> 1 = 1 < 5.5`.  
Sum from `3 -> 0 = 1 + 2 = 3 < 5.5`.  
Sum from `3 -> 2 = 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 >= 5.5`, median is node 2. | 2  
`[1, 2]` | `1 -> 0 -> 2` | `[2, 5]` | 7 | 3.5 |  Sum from `1 -> 0 = 2 < 3.5`.  
Sum from `1 -> 2 = 2 + 5 = 7 >= 3.5`, median is node 2. | 2  
  


**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `1 <= wi <= 109`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[j] == [uj, vj]`
  * `0 <= uj, vj < n`
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
