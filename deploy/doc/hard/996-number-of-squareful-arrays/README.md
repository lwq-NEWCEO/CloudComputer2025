# [Number of Squareful Arrays][title]

## Description

An array is **squareful** if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a
**perfect square**.

Given an integer array nums, return _the number of permutations of_`nums`
_that are**squareful**_.

Two permutations `perm1` and `perm2` are different if there is some index `i`
such that `perm1[i] != perm2[i]`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: nums = [1,17,8]    Output: 2    Explanation: [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: nums = [2,2,2]    Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 12`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`


**Tags:** Array, Hash Table, Math, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation, Bitmask DP

**Difficulty:** Hard
