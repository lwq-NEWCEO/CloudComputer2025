# [Total Sum of Interaction Cost in Tree Groups][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an undirected tree with `n` nodes numbered
from 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n -
1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes
`ui` and `vi`.

You are also given an integer array `group` of length `n`, where `group[i]`
denotes the group label assigned to node `i`.

  * Two nodes `u` and `v` are considered part of the same group if `group[u] == group[v]`.
  * The **interaction cost** between `u` and `v` is defined as the number of edges on the unique path connecting them in the tree.

Return an integer denoting the **sum** of interaction costs over all
**unordered** pairs `(u, v)` with `u != v` such that `group[u] == group[v]`.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], group = [1,1,1]

Output: 4

Explanation:

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/09/24/screenshot-2025-09-24-at-50538-pm.png)**

All nodes belong to group 1. The interaction costs between the pairs of nodes
are:

  * Nodes `(0, 1)`: 1
  * Nodes `(1, 2)`: 1
  * Nodes `(0, 2)`: 2

Thus, the total interaction cost is `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], group = [3,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation:

  * Nodes 0 and 2 belong to group 3. The interaction cost between this pair is 2.
  * Node 1 belongs to a different group and forms no valid pair. Therefore, the total interaction cost is 2.

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], group = [1,1,4,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/09/24/screenshot-2025-09-24-at-51312-pm.png)

Nodes belonging to the same groups and their interaction costs are:

  * Group 1: Nodes `(0, 1)`: 1
  * Group 4: Nodes `(2, 3)`: 2

Thus, the total interaction cost is `1 + 2 = 3`.

**Example 4:**

Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], group = [9,8]

Output: 0

Explanation:

All nodes belong to different groups and there are no valid pairs. Therefore,
the total interaction cost is 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
  * `group.length == n`
  * `1 <= group[i] <= 20`
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
