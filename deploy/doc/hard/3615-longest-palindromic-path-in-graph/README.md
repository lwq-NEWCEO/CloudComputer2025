# [Longest Palindromic Path in Graph][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n` and an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes
labeled from 0 to `n - 1` and a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
indicates an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

You are also given a string `label` of length `n`, where `label[i]` is the
character associated with node `i`.

You may start at any node and move to any adjacent node, visiting each node
**at most** once.

Return the **maximum** possible length of a **palindrome** that can be formed
by visiting a set of **unique** nodes along a valid path.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], label = "aba"

Output: 3

**Exp****lanation:**

  * The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 2 via node 1, following the path `0 -> 1 -> 2` forming string `"aba"`.
  * This is a valid palindrome of length 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], label = "abc"

Output: 1

Explanation:

  * No path with more than one node forms a palindrome.
  * The best option is any single node, giving a palindrome of length 1.

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[0,3],[3,1]], label = "bbac"

Output: 3

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/06/13/screenshot-2025-06-13-at-230508.png)

  * The longest palindromic path is from node 0 to node 1, following the path `0 -> 3 -> 1`, forming string `"bcb"`.
  * This is a valid palindrome of length 3.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 14`
  * `n - 1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
  * `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `label.length == n`
  * `label` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * There are no duplicate edges.
