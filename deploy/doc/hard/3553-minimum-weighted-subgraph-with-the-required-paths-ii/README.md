# [Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths II][title]

## Description

You are given an **undirected weighted** tree with `n` nodes, numbered from
`0` to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n -
1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between
nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight `wi`.​

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[j] =
[src1j, src2j, destj]`.

Return an array `answer` of length equal to `queries.length`, where
`answer[j]` is the **minimum total weight** of a subtree such that it is
possible to reach `destj` from both `src1j` and `src2j` using edges in this
subtree.

A **subtree** here is any connected subset of nodes and edges of the original
tree forming a valid tree.



**Example 1:**

Input: edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]], queries =
[[2,3,4],[0,2,5]]

Output: [12,11]

Explanation:

The blue edges represent one of the subtrees that yield the optimal answer.

  * `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 2` and `src2 = 3` to `dest = 4` is `3 + 5 + 4 = 12`.

  * `answer[1]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 2` to `dest = 5` is `2 + 3 + 6 = 11`.

**Example 2:**

Input: edges = [[1,0,8],[0,2,7]], queries = [[0,1,2]]

Output: [15]

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/02/tree1-5.jpg)

  * `answer[0]`: The total weight of the selected subtree that ensures a path from `src1 = 0` and `src2 = 1` to `dest = 2` is `8 + 7 = 15`.



**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i].length == 3`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `1 <= wi <= 104`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[j].length == 3`
  * `0 <= src1j, src2j, destj < n`
  * `src1j`, `src2j`, and `destj` are pairwise distinct.
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
