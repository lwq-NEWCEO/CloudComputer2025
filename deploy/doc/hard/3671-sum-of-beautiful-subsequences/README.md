# [Sum of Beautiful Subsequences][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

For every **positive** integer `g`, we define the **beauty** of `g` as the
**product** of `g` and the number of **strictly increasing** **subsequences**
of `nums` whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is exactly `g`.

Return the **sum** of **beauty** values for all positive integers `g`.

Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 10

Explanation:

All strictly increasing subsequences and their GCDs are:

Subsequence | GCD  
---|---  
[1] | 1  
[2] | 2  
[3] | 3  
[1,2] | 1  
[1,3] | 1  
[2,3] | 1  
[1,2,3] | 1  
  
Calculating beauty for each GCD:

GCD | Count of subsequences | Beauty (GCD × Count)  
---|---|---  
1 | 5 | 1 × 5 = 5  
2 | 1 | 2 × 1 = 2  
3 | 1 | 3 × 1 = 3  
  
Total beauty is `5 + 2 + 3 = 10`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [4,6]

Output: 12

Explanation:

All strictly increasing subsequences and their GCDs are:

Subsequence | GCD  
---|---  
[4] | 4  
[6] | 6  
[4,6] | 2  
  
Calculating beauty for each GCD:

GCD | Count of subsequences | Beauty (GCD × Count)  
---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 × 1 = 2  
4 | 1 | 4 × 1 = 4  
6 | 1 | 6 × 1 = 6  
  
Total beauty is `2 + 4 + 6 = 12`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == nums.length <= 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 7 * 104`


**Tags:** Array, Math, Tree, Number Theory
