# [Maximize Count of Distinct Primes After Split][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` having length `n` and a 2D integer array
`queries` where `queries[i] = [idx, val]`.

For each query:

  1. Update `nums[idx] = val`.
  2. Choose an integer `k` with `1 <= k < n` to split the array into the non-empty prefix `nums[0..k-1]` and suffix `nums[k..n-1]` such that the sum of the counts of **distinct** prime values in each part is **maximum**.

**Note:** The changes made to the array in one query persist into the next
query.

Return an array containing the result for each query, in the order they are
given.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,2], queries = [[1,2],[3,3]]

Output: [3,4]

Explanation:

  * Initially `nums = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]`.
  * After 1st query, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]`. Split `nums` into `[2]` and `[2, 3, 1, 2]`. `[2]` consists of 1 distinct prime and `[2, 3, 1, 2]` consists of 2 distinct primes. Hence, the answer for this query is `1 + 2 = 3`.
  * After 2nd query, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 2]`. Split `nums` into `[2, 2, 3]` and `[3, 2]` with an answer of `2 + 2 = 4`.
  * The output is `[3, 4]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [2,1,4], queries = [[0,1]]

Output: [0]

Explanation:

  * Initially `nums = [2, 1, 4]`.
  * After 1st query, `nums = [1, 1, 4]`. There are no prime numbers in `nums`, hence the answer for this query is 0.
  * The output is `[0]`.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
  * `0 <= queries[i][0] < nums.length`
  * `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 105`
