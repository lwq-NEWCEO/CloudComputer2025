# [Subtree Inversion Sum][title]

## Description

You are given an undirected tree rooted at node `0`, with `n` nodes numbered
from 0 to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of
length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an edge between nodes
`ui` and `vi`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]`
represents the value at node `i`, and an integer `k`.

You may perform **inversion operations** on a subset of nodes subject to the
following rules:

  * **Subtree Inversion Operation:**
    * When you invert a node, every value in the subtree rooted at that node is multiplied by -1.

  * **Distance Constraint on Inversions:**
    * You may only invert a node if it is "sufficiently far" from any other inverted node.
    * Specifically, if you invert two nodes `a` and `b` such that one is an ancestor of the other (i.e., if `LCA(a, b) = a` or `LCA(a, b) = b`), then the distance (the number of edges on the unique path between them) must be at least `k`.

Return the **maximum** possible **sum** of the tree's node values after
applying **inversion operations**.



**Example 1:**

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], nums =
[4,-8,-6,3,7,-2,5], k = 2

Output: 27

Explanation:

  * Apply inversion operations at nodes 0, 3, 4 and 6.
  * The final `nums` array is `[-4, 8, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5]`, and the total sum is 27.

**Example 2:**

Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], nums = [-1,3,-2,4,-5], k = 2

Output: 9

Explanation:

  * Apply the inversion operation at node 4.
  * The final `nums` array becomes `[-1, 3, -2, 4, 5]`, and the total sum is 9.

**Example 3:**

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], nums = [0,-1,-2], k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

Apply inversion operations at nodes 1 and 2.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `nums.length == n`
  * `-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104`
  * `1 <= k <= 50`
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
