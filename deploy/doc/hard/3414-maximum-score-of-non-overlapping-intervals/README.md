# [Maximum Score of Non-overlapping Intervals][title]

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [li, ri,
weighti]`. Interval `i` starts at position `li` and ends at `ri`, and has a
weight of `weighti`. You can choose _up to_ 4 **non-overlapping** intervals.
The **score** of the chosen intervals is defined as the total sum of their
weights.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of at most 4 indices from
`intervals` with **maximum** score, representing your choice of non-
overlapping intervals.

Two intervals are said to be **non-overlapping** if they do not share any
points. In particular, intervals sharing a left or right boundary are
considered overlapping.



**Example 1:**

Input: intervals = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5],[6,9,3],[6,7,1],[8,9,1]]

Output: [2,3]

Explanation:

You can choose the intervals with indices 2, and 3 with respective weights of
5, and 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: intervals =
[[5,8,1],[6,7,7],[4,7,3],[9,10,6],[7,8,2],[11,14,3],[3,5,5]]

Output: [1,3,5,6]

Explanation:

You can choose the intervals with indices 1, 3, 5, and 6 with respective
weights of 7, 6, 3, and 5.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= intevals.length <= 5 * 104`
  * `intervals[i].length == 3`
  * `intervals[i] = [li, ri, weighti]`
  * `1 <= li <= ri <= 109`
  * `1 <= weighti <= 109`
