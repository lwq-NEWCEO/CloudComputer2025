# [Find the Shortest Superstring][title]

## Description

Given an array of strings `words`, return _the smallest string that contains
each string in_ `words` _as a substring_. If there are multiple valid strings
of the smallest length, return **any of them**.

You may assume that no string in `words` is a substring of another string in
`words`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]    Output: "alexlovesleetcode"    Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.    

**Example 2:**
            Input: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]    Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= words.length <= 12`
  * `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
  * `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * All the strings of `words` are **unique**.
