# [Maximize Active Section with Trade II][title]

## Description

You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where:

  * `'1'` represents an **active** section.
  * `'0'` represents an **inactive** section.

You can perform **at most one trade** to maximize the number of active
sections in `s`. In a trade, you:

  * Convert a contiguous block of `'1'`s that is surrounded by `'0'`s to all `'0'`s.
  * Afterward, convert a contiguous block of `'0'`s that is surrounded by `'1'`s to all `'1'`s.

Additionally, you are given a **2D array** `queries`, where `queries[i] = [li,
ri]` represents a substring `s[li...ri]`.

For each query, determine the **maximum** possible number of active sections
in `s` after making the optimal trade on the substring `s[li...ri]`.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result for `queries[i]`.

**Note**

  * For each query, treat `s[li...ri]` as if it is **augmented** with a `'1'` at both ends, forming `t = '1' + s[li...ri] + '1'`. The augmented `'1'`s **do not** contribute to the final count.
  * The queries are independent of each other.



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "01", queries = [[0,1]]

Output: [1]

Explanation:

Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is
possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "0100", queries = [[0,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]

Output: [4,3,1,1]

Explanation:

  * Query `[0, 3]` -> Substring `"0100"` -> Augmented to `"101001"`  
Choose `"0100"`, convert `"0100"` -> `"0000"` -> `"1111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"1111"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 4.

  * Query `[0, 2]` -> Substring `"010"` -> Augmented to `"10101"`  
Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` -> `"000"` -> `"111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"1110"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 3.

  * Query `[1, 3]` -> Substring `"100"` -> Augmented to `"11001"`  
Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is
possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

  * Query `[2, 3]` -> Substring `"00"` -> Augmented to `"1001"`  
Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is
possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "1000100", queries = [[1,5],[0,6],[0,4]]

Output: [6,7,2]

Explanation:

  * Query `[1, 5]` -> Substring `"00010"` -> Augmented to `"1000101"`  
Choose `"00010"`, convert `"00010"` -> `"00000"` -> `"11111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"1111110"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 6.

  * Query `[0, 6]` -> Substring `"1000100"` -> Augmented to `"110001001"`  
Choose `"000100"`, convert `"000100"` -> `"000000"` -> `"111111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"1111111"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 7.

  * Query `[0, 4]` -> Substring `"10001"` -> Augmented to `"1100011"`  
Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is
possible. The maximum number of active sections is 2.

**Example 4:**

Input: s = "01010", queries = [[0,3],[1,4],[1,3]]

Output: [4,4,2]

Explanation:

  * Query `[0, 3]` -> Substring `"0101"` -> Augmented to `"101011"`  
Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` -> `"000"` -> `"111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"11110"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 4.

  * Query `[1, 4]` -> Substring `"1010"` -> Augmented to `"110101"`  
Choose `"010"`, convert `"010"` -> `"000"` -> `"111"`.  
The final string without augmentation is `"01111"`. The maximum number of
active sections is 4.

  * Query `[1, 3]` -> Substring `"101"` -> Augmented to `"11011"`  
Because there is no block of `'1'`s surrounded by `'0'`s, no valid trade is
possible. The maximum number of active sections is 2.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == s.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
  * `queries[i] = [li, ri]`
  * `0 <= li <= ri < n`
