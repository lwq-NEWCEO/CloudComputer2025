# [Lexicographically Smallest String After Deleting Duplicate Characters][title]

## Description

You are given a string `s` that consists of lowercase English letters.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero
times):

  * Choose any letter that appears **at least twice** in the current string `s` and delete any **one** occurrence.

Return the **lexicographically smallest** resulting string that can be formed
this way.



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "aaccb"

Output: "aacb"

Explanation:

We can form the strings `"acb"`, `"aacb"`, `"accb"`, and `"aaccb"`. `"aacb"`
is the lexicographically smallest one.

For example, we can obtain `"aacb"` by choosing `'c'` and deleting its first
occurrence.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "z"

Output: "z"

Explanation:

We cannot perform any operations. The only string we can form is `"z"`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` contains lowercase English letters only.


**Tags:** 

**Difficulty:** Hard
