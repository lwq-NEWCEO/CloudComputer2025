# [Minimum Inversion Count in Subarrays of Fixed Length][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

An **inversion** is a pair of indices `(i, j)` from `nums` such that `i < j`
and `nums[i] > nums[j]`.

The **inversion count** of a **subarray** is the number of inversions within
it.

Return the **minimum** inversion count among all **subarrays** of `nums` with
length `k`.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [3,1,2,5,4], k = 3

Output: 0

Explanation:

We consider all subarrays of length `k = 3` (indices below are relative to
each subarray):

  * `[3, 1, 2]` has 2 inversions: `(0, 1)` and `(0, 2)`.
  * `[1, 2, 5]` has 0 inversions.
  * `[2, 5, 4]` has 1 inversion: `(1, 2)`.

The minimum inversion count among all subarrays of length `3` is 0, achieved
by subarray `[1, 2, 5]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [5,3,2,1], k = 4

Output: 6

Explanation:

There is only one subarray of length `k = 4`: `[5, 3, 2, 1]`.  
Within this subarray, the inversions are: `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, `(0, 3)`, `(1,
2)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(2, 3)`.  
Total inversions is 6, so the minimum inversion count is 6.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [2,1], k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

All subarrays of length `k = 1` contain only one element, so no inversions are
possible.  
The minimum inversion count is therefore 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= n`
