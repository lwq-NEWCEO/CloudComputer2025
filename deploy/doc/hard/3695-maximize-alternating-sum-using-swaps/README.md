# [Maximize Alternating Sum Using Swaps][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You want to maximize the **alternating sum** of `nums`, which is defined as
the value obtained by **adding** elements at even indices and **subtracting**
elements at odd indices. That is, `nums[0] - nums[1] + nums[2] - nums[3]...`

You are also given a 2D integer array `swaps` where `swaps[i] = [pi, qi]`. For
each pair `[pi, qi]` in `swaps`, you are allowed to swap the elements at
indices `pi` and `qi`. These swaps can be performed any number of times and in
any order.

Return the maximum possible **alternating sum** of `nums`.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], swaps = [[0,2],[1,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The maximum alternating sum is achieved when `nums` is `[2, 1, 3]` or `[3, 1,
2]`. As an example, you can obtain `nums = [2, 1, 3]` as follows.

  * Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[3, 2, 1]`.
  * Swap `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[3, 1, 2]`.
  * Swap `nums[0]` and `nums[2]`. `nums` is now `[2, 1, 3]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], swaps = [[1,2]]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The maximum alternating sum is achieved by not performing any swaps.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [1,1000000000,1,1000000000,1,1000000000], swaps = []

Output: -2999999997

Explanation:

Since we cannot perform any swaps, the maximum alternating sum is achieved by
not performing any swaps.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `0 <= swaps.length <= 105`
  * `swaps[i] = [pi, qi]`
  * `0 <= pi < qi <= nums.length - 1`
  * `[pi, qi] != [pj, qj]`
