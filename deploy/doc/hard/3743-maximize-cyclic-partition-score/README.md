# [Maximize Cyclic Partition Score][title]

## Description

You are given a **cyclic** array `nums` and an integer `k`.

**Partition** `nums` into **at most** `k`**** subarrays. As `nums` is cyclic,
these subarrays may wrap around from the end of the array back to the
beginning.

The **range** of a subarray is the difference between its **maximum** and
**minimum** values. The **score** of a partition is the sum of subarray
**ranges**.

Return the **maximum** possible **score** among all cyclic partitions.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 2

Output: 3

Explanation:

  * Partition `nums` into `[2, 3]` and `[3, 1]` (wrapped around).
  * The range of `[2, 3]` is `max(2, 3) - min(2, 3) = 3 - 2 = 1`.
  * The range of `[3, 1]` is `max(3, 1) - min(3, 1) = 3 - 1 = 2`.
  * The score is `1 + 2 = 3`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

  * Partition `nums` into `[1, 2, 3, 3]`.
  * The range of `[1, 2, 3, 3]` is `max(1, 2, 3, 3) - min(1, 2, 3, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2`.
  * The score is 2.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

Identical to Example 1, we partition `nums` into `[2, 3]` and `[3, 1]`. Note
that `nums` may be partitioned into fewer than `k` subarrays.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= nums.length`
