# [Longest Duplicate Substring][title]

## Description

Given a string `s`, consider all _duplicated substrings_ : (contiguous)
substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.

Return **any** duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If
`s` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.



**Example 1:**
            Input: s = "banana"    Output: "ana"    

**Example 2:**
            Input: s = "abcd"    Output: ""    



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
