# [Next Special Palindrome Number][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n`.

A number is called **special** if:

  * It is a **palindrome**.
  * Every digit `k` in the number appears **exactly** `k` times.

Return the **smallest** special number **strictly** greater than `n`.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 2

Output: 22

Explanation:

22 is the smallest special number greater than 2, as it is a palindrome and
the digit 2 appears exactly 2 times.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 33

Output: 212

Explanation:

212 is the smallest special number greater than 33, as it is a palindrome and
the digits 1 and 2 appear exactly 1 and 2 times respectively.  



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= n <= 1015`


**Tags:** Backtracking, Bit Manipulation

**Difficulty:** Hard
