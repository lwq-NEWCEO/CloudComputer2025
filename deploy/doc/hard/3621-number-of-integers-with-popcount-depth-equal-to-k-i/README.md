# [Number of Integers With Popcount-Depth Equal to K I][title]

## Description

You are given two integers `n` and `k`.

For any positive integer `x`, define the following sequence:

  * `p0 = x`
  * `pi+1 = popcount(pi)` for all `i >= 0`, where `popcount(y)` is the number of set bits (1's) in the binary representation of `y`.

This sequence will eventually reach the value 1.

The **popcount-depth** of `x` is defined as the **smallest** integer `d >= 0`
such that `pd = 1`.

For example, if `x = 7` (binary representation `"111"`). Then, the sequence
is: `7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`, so the popcount-depth of 7 is 3.

Your task is to determine the number of integers in the range `[1, n]` whose
popcount-depth is **exactly** equal to `k`.

Return the number of such integers.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 4, k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

The following integers in the range `[1, 4]` have popcount-depth exactly equal
to 1:

x | Binary | Sequence  
---|---|---  
2 | `"10"` | `2 -> 1`  
4 | `"100"` | `4 -> 1`  
  
Thus, the answer is 2.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 7, k = 2

Output: 3

Explanation:

The following integers in the range `[1, 7]` have popcount-depth exactly equal
to 2:

x | Binary | Sequence  
---|---|---  
3 | `"11"` | `3 -> 2 -> 1`  
5 | `"101"` | `5 -> 2 -> 1`  
6 | `"110"` | `6 -> 2 -> 1`  
  
Thus, the answer is 3.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 1015`
  * `0 <= k <= 5`
