# [Number of Effective Subsequences][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

The **strength** of the array is defined as the **bitwise OR** of all its
elements.

A **subsequence** is considered **effective** if removing that subsequence
**strictly decreases** the strength of the remaining elements.

Return the number of **effective subsequences** in `nums`. Since the answer
may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

The bitwise OR of an empty array is 0.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

  * The Bitwise OR of the array is `1 OR 2 OR 3 = 3`.
  * Subsequences that are effective are:     * `[1, 3]`: The remaining element `[2]` has a Bitwise OR of 2.    * `[2, 3]`: The remaining element `[1]` has a Bitwise OR of 1.    * `[1, 2, 3]`: The remaining elements `[]` have a Bitwise OR of 0.
  * Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 3.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [7,4,6]

Output: 4

Explanation: ​​​​​​​

  * The Bitwise OR of the array is `7 OR 4 OR 6 = 7`.
  * Subsequences that are effective are:     * `[7]`: The remaining elements `[4, 6]` have a Bitwise OR of 6.    * `[7, 4]`: The remaining element `[6]` has a Bitwise OR of 6.    * `[7, 6]`: The remaining element `[4]` has a Bitwise OR of 4.    * `[7, 4, 6]`: The remaining elements `[]` have a Bitwise OR of 0.
  * Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 4.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [8,8]

Output: 1

Explanation:

  * The Bitwise OR of the array is `8 OR 8 = 8`.
  * Only the subsequence `[8, 8]` is effective since removing it leaves `[]` which has a Bitwise OR of 0.
  * Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 1.

**Example 4:**

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 5

Explanation:

  * The Bitwise OR of the array is `2 OR 2 OR 1 = 3`.
  * Subsequences that are effective are:     * `[1]`: The remaining elements `[2, 2]` have a Bitwise OR of 2.    * `[2, 1]` (using `nums[0]`, `nums[2]`): The remaining element `[2]` has a Bitwise OR of 2.    * `[2, 1]` (using `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`): The remaining element `[2]` has a Bitwise OR of 2.    * `[2, 2]`: The remaining element `[1]` has a Bitwise OR of 1.    * `[2, 2, 1]`: The remaining elements `[]` have a Bitwise OR of 0.
  * Thus, the total number of effective subsequences is 5.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
