# [Minimum Edge Toggles on a Tree][title]

## Description

You are given an **undirected tree** with `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n -
1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`​​​​​​​ of length `n - 1`,
where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai`
and `bi` in the tree.

You are also given two **binary** strings `start` and `target` of length `n`.
For each node `x`, `start[x]` is its initial color and `target[x]` is its
desired color.

In one operation, you may pick an edge with index `i` and **toggle** both of
its endpoints. That is, if the edge is `[u, v]`, then the colors of nodes `u`
and `v` **each** flip from `'0'` to `'1'` or from `'1'` to `'0'`.

Return an array of edge indices whose operations transform `start` into
`target`. Among all valid sequences with **minimum possible length** , return
the edge indices in **increasing** ​​​​​​​ order.

If it is impossible to transform `start` into `target`, return an array
containing a single element equal to -1.



**Example 1:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/12/18/example1.png)​​​​​​​**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], start = "010", target = "100"

Output: [0]

Explanation:

Toggle edge with index 0, which flips nodes 0 and 1.  
​​​​​​​The string changes from `"010"` to `"100"`, matching the target.

**Example 2:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/12/18/example2.png)**

Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[3,5],[1,6]], start =
"0011000", target = "0010001"

Output: [1,2,5]

Explanation:

  * Toggle edge with index 1, which flips nodes 1 and 2.
  * Toggle edge with index 2, which flips nodes 2 and 3.
  * Toggle edge with index 5, which flips nodes 1 and 6.

After these operations, the resulting string becomes `"0010001"`, which
matches the target.

**Example 3:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/12/18/example3.png)​​​​​​​**

Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]], start = "00", target = "01"

Output: [-1]

Explanation:

There is no sequence of edge toggles that transforms `"00"` into `"01"`.
Therefore, we return `[-1]`.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n == start.length == target.length <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`
  * `0 <= ai, bi < n`
  * `start[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
  * `target[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
  * The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
