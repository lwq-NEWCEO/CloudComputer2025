# [Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `n`, representing `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n -
1` and a list of `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`:

  * `ui` and `vi` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.
  * `si` is the strength of the edge.
  * `musti` is an integer (0 or 1). If `musti == 1`, the edge **must** be included in the******spanning tree**. These edges **cannot** be **upgraded**.

You are also given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of upgrades you can
perform. Each upgrade **doubles** the strength of an edge, and each eligible
edge (with `musti == 0`) can be upgraded **at most** once.

The **stability** of a spanning tree is defined as the **minimum** strength
score among all edges included in it.

Return the **maximum** possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is
impossible to connect all nodes, return `-1`.

**Note** : A **spanning tree** of a graph with `n` nodes is a subset of the
edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is **connected**)
_without_ forming any cycles, and uses **exactly** `n - 1` edges.



**Example 1:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

  * Edge `[0,1]` with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
  * Edge `[1,2]` is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade.
  * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6.
  * The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability.

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

  * Since all edges are optional and up to `k = 2` upgrades are allowed.
  * Upgrade edges `[0,1]` from 4 to 8 and `[1,2]` from 3 to 6.
  * The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and 6.
  * The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible stability.

**Example 3:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0

Output: -1

Explanation:

  * All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `1 <= edges.length <= 105`
  * `edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]`
  * `0 <= ui, vi < n`
  * `ui != vi`
  * `1 <= si <= 105`
  * `musti` is either `0` or `1`.
  * `0 <= k <= n`
  * There are no duplicate edges.
