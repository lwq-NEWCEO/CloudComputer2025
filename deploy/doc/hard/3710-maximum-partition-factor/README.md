# [Maximum Partition Factor][title]

## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`
represents the coordinates of the `ith` point on the Cartesian plane.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `points[i] = [xi, yi]` and
`points[j] = [xj, yj]` is `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

Split the `n` points into **exactly two non-empty** groups. The **partition
factor** of a split is the **minimum** Manhattan distance among all unordered
pairs of points that lie in the same group.

Return the **maximum** possible **partition factor** over all valid splits.

Note: A group of size 1 contributes no intra-group pairs. When `n = 2` (both
groups size 1), there are no intra-group pairs, so define the partition factor
as 0.



**Example 1:**

Input: points = [[0,0],[0,2],[2,0],[2,2]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

We split the points into two groups: `{[0, 0], [2, 2]}` and `{[0, 2], [2,
0]}`.

  * In the first group, the only pair has Manhattan distance `|0 - 2| + |0 - 2| = 4`.

  * In the second group, the only pair also has Manhattan distance `|0 - 2| + |2 - 0| = 4`.

The partition factor of this split is `min(4, 4) = 4`, which is maximal.

**Example 2:**

Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[10,0]]

Output: 11

**Explanation:​​​​​​​**

We split the points into two groups: `{[0, 1], [10, 0]}` and `{[0, 0]}`.

  * In the first group, the only pair has Manhattan distance `|0 - 10| + |1 - 0| = 11`.

  * The second group is a singleton, so it contributes no pairs.

The partition factor of this split is `11`, which is maximal.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= points.length <= 500`
  * `points[i] = [xi, yi]`
  * `-108 <= xi, yi <= 108`
