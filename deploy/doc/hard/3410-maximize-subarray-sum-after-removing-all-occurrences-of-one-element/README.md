# [Maximize Subarray Sum After Removing All Occurrences of One Element][title]

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You can do the following operation on the array **at most** once:

  * Choose **any** integer `x` such that `nums` remains **non-empty** on removing all occurrences of `x`.
  * Remove **all** occurrences of `x` from the array.

Return the **maximum** subarray sum across **all** possible resulting arrays.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]

Output: 7

Explanation:

We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:

  * The original array is `nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, _**3, -2, 3**_]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
  * Deleting all occurences of `x = -3` results in `nums = [2, -2, -1, **_3, -2, 3_**]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
  * Deleting all occurences of `x = -2` results in `nums = [-3, **_2, -1, 3, 3_**]`. The maximum subarray sum is `2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7`.
  * Deleting all occurences of `x = -1` results in `nums = [-3, 2, -2, **_3, -2, 3_**]`. The maximum subarray sum is `3 + (-2) + 3 = 4`.
  * Deleting all occurences of `x = 3` results in `nums = [-3, _**2**_ , -2, -1, -2]`. The maximum subarray sum is 2.

The output is `max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 10

Explanation:

It is optimal to not perform any operations.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
