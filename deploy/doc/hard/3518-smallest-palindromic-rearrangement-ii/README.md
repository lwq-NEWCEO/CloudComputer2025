# [Smallest Palindromic Rearrangement II][title]

## Description

You are given a **palindromic** string `s` and an integer `k`.

Return the **k-th** **lexicographically smallest** palindromic permutation of
`s`. If there are fewer than `k` distinct palindromic permutations, return an
empty string.

**Note:** Different rearrangements that yield the same palindromic string are
considered identical and are counted once.



**Example 1:**

Input: s = "abba", k = 2

Output: "baab"

Explanation:

  * The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of `"abba"` are `"abba"` and `"baab"`.
  * Lexicographically, `"abba"` comes before `"baab"`. Since `k = 2`, the output is `"baab"`.

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "aa", k = 2

Output: ""

Explanation:

  * There is only one palindromic rearrangement: `"aa"`.
  * The output is an empty string since `k = 2` exceeds the number of possible rearrangements.

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "bacab", k = 1

Output: "abcba"

Explanation:

  * The two distinct palindromic rearrangements of `"bacab"` are `"abcba"` and `"bacab"`.
  * Lexicographically, `"abcba"` comes before `"bacab"`. Since `k = 1`, the output is `"abcba"`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
  * `s` is guaranteed to be palindromic.
  * `1 <= k <= 106`
