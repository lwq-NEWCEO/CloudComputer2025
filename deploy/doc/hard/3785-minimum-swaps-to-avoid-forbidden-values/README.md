# [Minimum Swaps to Avoid Forbidden Values][title]

## Description

You are given two integer arrays, `nums` and `forbidden`, each of length `n`.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

  * Choose two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]`.

Return the **minimum** number of swaps required such that, for every index
`i`, the value of `nums[i]` is **not equal** to `forbidden[i]`. If no amount
of swaps can ensure that every index avoids its forbidden value, return -1.



**Example 1:**

Input: nums = [1,2,3], forbidden = [3,2,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

One optimal set of swaps:

  * Select indices `i = 0` and `j = 1` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [2, 1, 3]`.
  * After this swap, for every index `i`, `nums[i]` is not equal to `forbidden[i]`.

**Example 2:**

Input: nums = [4,6,6,5], forbidden = [4,6,5,5]

Output: 2

Explanation:

One optimal set of swaps:

  * Select indices `i = 0` and `j = 2` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [6, 6, 4, 5]`.
  * Select indices `i = 1` and `j = 3` in `nums` and swap them, resulting in `nums = [6, 5, 4, 6]`.
  * After these swaps, for every index `i`, `nums[i]` is not equal to `forbidden[i]`.

**Example 3:**

Input: nums = [7,7], forbidden = [8,7]

Output: -1

Explanation:

It is not possible to make `nums[i]` different from `forbidden[i]` for all
indices.

**Example 4:**

Input: nums = [1,2], forbidden = [2,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No swaps are required because `nums[i]` is already different from
`forbidden[i]` for all indices, so the answer is 0.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n == nums.length == forbidden.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i], forbidden[i] <= 109`
