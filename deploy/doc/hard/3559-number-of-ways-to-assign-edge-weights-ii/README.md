# [Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II][title]

## Description

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at
node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n -
1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes
`ui` and `vi`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of
either **1** or **2**.

The **cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight
of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [ui, vi]`,
determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges **in the path** such
that the cost of the path between `ui` and `vi` is **odd**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments
for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply **modulo** `109 + 7` to each `answer[i]`.

**Note:** For each query, disregard all edges **not** in the path between node
`ui` and `vi`.



**Example 1:**

Input: edges = [[1,2]], queries = [[1,1],[1,2]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

  * Query `[1,1]`: The path from Node 1 to itself consists of no edges, so the cost is 0. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 0.
  * Query `[1,2]`: The path from Node 1 to Node 2 consists of one edge (`1 -> 2`). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/23/screenshot-2025-03-24-at-055820.png)

Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], queries = [[1,4],[3,4],[2,5]]

Output: [2,1,4]

Explanation:

  * Query `[1,4]`: The path from Node 1 to Node 4 consists of two edges (`1 -> 3` and `3 -> 4`). Assigning weights (1,2) or (2,1) results in an odd cost. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 2.
  * Query `[3,4]`: The path from Node 3 to Node 4 consists of one edge (`3 -> 4`). Assigning weight 1 makes the cost odd, while 2 makes it even. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 1.
  * Query `[2,5]`: The path from Node 2 to Node 5 consists of three edges (`2 -> 1, 1 -> 3`, and `3 -> 5`). Assigning (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), or (1,1,1) makes the cost odd. Thus, the number of valid assignments is 4.



**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= n <= 105`
  * `edges.length == n - 1`
  * `edges[i] == [ui, vi]`
  * `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
  * `queries[i] == [ui, vi]`
  * `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
  * `edges` represents a valid tree.
