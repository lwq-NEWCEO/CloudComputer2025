# [Maximize the Distance Between Points on a Square][title]

## Description

You are given an integer `side`, representing the edge length of a square with
corners at `(0, 0)`, `(0, side)`, `(side, 0)`, and `(side, side)` on a
Cartesian plane.

You are also given a **positive** integer `k` and a 2D integer array `points`,
where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinate of a point lying on the
**boundary** of the square.

You need to select `k` elements among `points` such that the **minimum**
Manhattan distance between any two points is **maximized**.

Return the **maximum** possible **minimum** Manhattan distance between the
selected `k` points.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is `|xi -
xj| + |yi - yj|`.



**Example 1:**

Input: side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4

Output: 2

Select all four points.

**Example 2:**

Input: side = 2, points = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 4

Output: 1

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/01/28/4080_example1_revised.png)

Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(2, 0)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 1)`.

**Example 3:**

Input: side = 2, points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k =
5

Output: 1

Explanation:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/01/28/4080_example2_revised.png)

Select the points `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 2)`.



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= side <= 109`
  * `4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 103)`
  * `points[i] == [xi, yi]`
  * The input is generated such that:     * `points[i]` lies on the boundary of the square.    * All `points[i]` are **unique**.
  * `4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)`
